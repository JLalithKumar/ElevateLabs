# Bank Account Simulation

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI) based application** to simulate basic bank operations using Java OOP principles.

---

## Objective
To create a Java program that allows users to **create an account, deposit, withdraw, and check balance**, while maintaining **transaction history**. The program simulates real-world banking operations in a structured and interactive manner.

---

## Features
- **Create Account** – Input account holder name, account number, and initial balance.  
- **Deposit Money** – Add money to the account with transaction logging.  
- **Withdraw Money** – Deduct money from the account with balance validation.  
- **Check Balance** – Display the current account balance.  
- **Transaction History** – Maintain and view a list of all transactions.  
- **Menu-Driven Interface** – Provides simple and intuitive options for interacting with the account.  

---

## Implementation Details
- **Account Class** – Contains properties for account holder name, account number, balance, and transaction history. Provides methods for deposit, withdrawal, checking balance, and printing transaction history.  
- **BankAccountSimulation Class** – Contains the main method and a menu-driven interface for user interaction.  
- **ArrayList** – Used to maintain transaction history dynamically.  
- **Scanner** – Used to read user input from the console.  
- **Encapsulation & OOP Principles** – Demonstrates use of classes, objects, methods, and private data members.  

---

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical example of **Java OOP and CLI-based programming**. It demonstrates how to design and implement a **menu-driven banking system** that **maintains account state and transaction history**, simulating real-world banking operations in a simple and structured manner.
