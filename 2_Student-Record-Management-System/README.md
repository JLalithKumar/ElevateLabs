# Student Record Management System

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI) based CRUD system** to manage student records efficiently.

## Objective
To create a Java program that allows users to **add, view, update, and delete** student records using a structured approach.

## Features
- **Add Student** – Input student ID, name, and marks to add a new record.  
- **View Students** – Display all student records in a readable format.  
- **Update Student** – Modify existing student details based on student ID.  
- **Delete Student** – Remove a student record from the system.  

## Implementation Details
- **Student Class** – Encapsulates student data (ID, Name, Marks).  
- **ArrayList** – Stores all student objects dynamically.  
- **Menu-Driven Interface** – Provides intuitive options for CRUD operations.  

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical example of **object-oriented programming and data management** in Java. It demonstrates how to design and implement a structured program with CRUD functionality using classes, objects, and ArrayLists.
